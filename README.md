Welcome to our ship !

To enter our website open the "The Ship With No Name.html" on your favorite web browser.

Please note that the login buttons are not currently functional and the welcome page has been omitted.
In order to login, use 'test tools' buttons with respective user categories.

Make sure to select a user type FIRST, then load the page. 
E.g. Select Staff / Manager before selecting the inventory page (all categories have varying functions e.g. can/can't add stock, security button...).

While the test tools can be used to jump between the main pages, the navigation bar menu items "Order" & "Inventory" are fully functional.

Lastly, the following are possible as seen in the code under folder 'Model', but are yet to be implemented in the view due to time constraints:

- Hide / Show inventory items (view list of hidden items).
- VIP list and adding currency to VIP member.
- Filtering of beverages.
